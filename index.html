                <li><b>Laziness:</b> The quality that makes you go to great
                effort to reduce overall expenditure. It makes you write labor-
                saving programs that other people will find useful and 
                document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many
                questions about it.</li>
                <li><b>Impatience:</b> The anger you feel when the computer
                is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just
                react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least
                pretend to.</li>
                <li><b>Hubris:</b> The quality that makes your write (and 
                maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad 
                things about.</li>

                    <p>Description: I managed the daily incremental backups using Tivoli
                    Backup Manager software and managed the TSM Tape Library,

                    and Microsoft Excel to create inventory lists of server
                    specifications and warranties. I communicated with
                    technical support teams to troubleshoot server issues and
                    provide customer support. I also assisted in the
                    virtualization of new and older physical servers utilizing

                    <p>Title: IS&amp;T Summer Intern</p>
                    <p>Description: I worked as a full-time intern for the Information
                    Security &amp; Technology department at the Chemical Agent-
                    Destruction Pilot Plant (PCAPP) in Pueblo, Colorado. In
                    order to work on the government site I had to complete
                    security and safety training, which allowed my to work as
                    a government contractor. I helped to create interactive
                    analytical reports using QlikView, a business intelligence
                    software. Because these reports were cross-functional, I
                    gained experience interfacing within other departments from
                    an IT perspective. I also aided in the physical management 
                    and assisted in rewiring the server room.</p>
