This folder is where you should put your webpage.  Files places here
can be accessed via the web at the address

http://agora.cs.wcu.edu/~yourusername/

Here are some things to keep in mind when building your webpage. 

- You can use HTML and javascript, but PHP and Perl are not available.
- Web files should be stored in ~/public_html
- If you aren't able to access your files via the web remember to check
  permissions.
  - Your home directory should be executable by other (chmod o+x ~)
  - All files in public_html need to be readable by other and 
    directories need to be executable by other.  By default other has no 
    permissions on newly created files and directories. You can either 
    add the appropriate permissions for other after you create your webpage 
    files, or you can change your umask to something more permissive 
    like 0002 before creating them.
